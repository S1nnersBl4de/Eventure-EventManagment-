  <h1>About Eventure</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>Eventure</strong> â€” your trusted event management platform.
    This website, including both the frontend and backend, was entirely designed, coded, and built from scratch by me as part of my software development studies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventure was created with the goal of showcasing full-stack web development skills, covering both responsive frontend design and a robust, secure backend API. 
    It features user authentication, event browsing, ticket purchasing systems, and dynamic search & filtering functionalities.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project is a reflection of my growth, passion, and continuous learning journey in the world of web development.
